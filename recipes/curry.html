    <p>A completed bowl of curry with rice and pickled veggies</p>

    <p>This is a Japanese dish that first caught on with the Japanese Navy as an easily storable
        food that could be rehydrated rapidly. It was useful in preventing scurvy, a common malaise 
        amongst Japanese sailors.
